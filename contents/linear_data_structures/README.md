<h1>Linear Data Structures</h1>

<p>Linear data structures are data collections whose items are ordered depending on how they are added or removed. Once an item is added, it stays in that position relative to the other elements that came before and came after it. Linear structures can be thought of as having two ends. Sometimes these ends are referred to as the "left" and the "right" or in some cases the "front" and the "rear". You could also call them the "top" and the "bottom". The names given to the ends are not significant. What distinguishes one linear structure from another is the way in which items are added and removed, in particular the location where theses additions and removals occur. Linear data structures are some of the most useful data structures in computer science. They appear in many algorithms and can be used to solve a variety of important problems.</p>
